Project Overview (SMS Spam Classifier)
This project classifies SMS messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using Machine Learning and natural language processing (NLP). The system extracts text features using TF-IDF Vectorization and applies a trained classification model to detect suspicious or fraudulent messages. A Flask-based web interface allows users to enter a message and receive real-time classification results, helping prevent phishing, scam, and social engineering attacks through SMS.
